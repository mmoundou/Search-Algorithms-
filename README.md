# **Motivation**

Most programming libraries have pre-defined search algorithms; leveraging them allows for efficient software development 
and peace of mind (as most of them have been thoroughly tested for reliability). They are not suited for all situations,
however, especially when dealing with custom API's, 
so I figured playing around designing a search algorithm of my own would be a cool enterprise.
