# **Motivation**

Most programming libraries have pre-defined search algorithms; leveraging them allows for efficient software development 
and peace of mind (as most of them have been thoroughly tested for reliability). They are not suited for all situations,
however, especially when dealing with custom API's, 
so I figured that redesigning one popular search algorithm from scratch (the Binary Search algorithm) 
would be a good way to play around with the fundamentals and verify that I can build search algorithms of my own.
