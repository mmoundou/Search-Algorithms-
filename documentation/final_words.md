# **Final Words**

At the beginning of this project, I started with the desire to practice; I was bored on a Friday night, and, instead of
going out to grab some drinks, I figured that playing with some *algorithms* would be a good way to spend time.
All jokes aside, this exercise was a nice reminder that very few things (if any) are set in stone, especially when it 
comes to software development. What is the solution to one problem, might well turn out to be the catalyst to another,
so it's important to understand the fundamentals while having the flexibility to tailor them to different scenarios. I 
am no expert algorithmer--totally made up word--but it's nice to know that I already got the ball rolling in the right
direction.
