# **Introduction 


Let "myTree" be a tree with the following nodes: "node_1", "node_2", and "node_3";
the tree is arranged so that each node has at most 02 other nodes related to it. These related nodes will be the initial
node's children, with both the parent node and children nodes typically arranged in a triangle-like shape, so that the
parent node occupies the top edge and the children nodes the base edges. 

Traversing such a tree would consist of querying each node, retrieving its value, and comparing it to the value we are 
searching for, then indicating whether there is a match: in such a case, the search would stop; otherwise, we would
continue traversing the tree until either the desired value was found or we had no more nodes to query.
